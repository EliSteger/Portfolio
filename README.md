This app is intended to be used for event creation and planning. The user needs that were addressed are the needs for a platform to create and share events either at physical locations or virtually.

I prefer to keep the UI design simple, easy to read, and easy to navigate. The overally idea is to be able to login and get started right away on finding and creating events.

I planned out the coding process before getting started. I didn't get very far unfortunately as I clearly need to learn more about SQLite.

I used the emulator included in Android Studio to test my code. This process is important because I would much rather find errors myself than have users find them.

My planning and design ability were fine. My biggest issue was coding some of the parts. I'm still struggling with adjusting to Android Studio and I've been jumping around in different languages so I feel like I never have the time to really get a deep understanding of a single language or tool. Basically I had to innovate with coding itself by digging around and looking for different ways to do what I needed.

I think the only thing I was particularly successful in was the overall creation of the login screen.
